# MTTL

MTTL - Multi-Task Transfer Learning

## Setup

MTTL supports `Python 3.8` and `Python 3.9`. It is recommended to create a virtual environment for MTTL using `virtualenv` or `conda`. For example, with `conda`:

    conda create -n mttl python=3.9
    conda activate mttl

Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -e .

## Data Preparation

Download and prepare the datasets for the experiments using the following script:

    bash scripts/create_datasets.sh



## Multi-task Pre-training

The general command:

`python pl_train.py -c $CONFIG_FILES -k $KWARGS`

Multiple `CONFIG_FILES` can be concatenated as `file1+file2`. To modify defaults, `KWARGS` can be expressed as `key=value`.

## Test Fine-Tuning

To perform finetuning for a test task, use the script `pl_finetune.py`

## Hyper-parameter Search for Test Fine-Tuning

To perform an hyperparameter search for a test task, use the script `pl_finetune_tune.py`.
The script will just call the functions in `pl_finetune.py` in a loop. The script itself defines hp ranges for different fine-tuning types.


## Running Tests

    pip install -e ".[test]"
    pytest -vv tests
