# MTTL

MTTL - Multi-Task Transfer Learning

## Setup

MTTL supports `Python 3.8` and `Python 3.9`. It is recommended to create a virtual environment for MTTL using `virtualenv` or `conda`. For example, with `conda`:

    conda create -n mttl python=3.9
    conda activate mttl

Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -e .



## Multi-Head Adapter Routing

Please ensure that you have navigated to the `projects/mhr` directory before running the Multi-Head Adapter Routing scripts:

    cd projects/mhr


### Data Preparation

Download and prepare the datasets for the experiments using the following script:

    bash datasets/create_datasets.sh


### Environment Variables

Based on your experiments, you may need to export one or more of the following environment variables:

    T0_DATA_DIR:  `data/t0_data/processed` if you ran the `create_datasets.sh`
    NI_DATA_DIR: `data/ni_data/processed` if you ran the `create_datasets.sh`
    XFIT_DATA_DIR: `data/ni_data/processed` if you ran the `create_datasets.sh`
    CHECKPOINT_DIR
    OUTPUT_DIR
    CACHE_DIR
    STORYCLOZE_DIR: path to your downloaded `.csv` files. See [the storycloze official website](https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/)


### Multi-task Pre-training

The general command for pre-training a model is:

    python pl_train.py -c $CONFIG_FILES -k $KWARGS

Multiple `CONFIG_FILES` can be concatenated as `file1+file2`. To modify defaults, `KWARGS` can be expressed as `key=value`.
You can check [scripts/pretrain](scripts/pretrain) for examples.

### Test Fine-Tuning

To perform finetuning for a test task, use the script `pl_finetune.py`

### Hyper-parameter Search for Test Fine-Tuning

To perform an hyperparameter search for a test task, use the script `pl_finetune_tune.py`.
The script will just call the functions in `pl_finetune.py` in a loop. The script itself defines hp ranges for different fine-tuning types.


### Pre-Configured Scripts

Alternatively, you can run the pre-configured scripts from the `scripts` folder. For example:

    bash scripts/mhr_pretrain.sh

### Know Issues
If you run into issues with protoc `TypeError: Descriptors cannot not be created directly.`, you can try to downgrade protobuf to 3.20.*:

    pip install protobuf==3.20.*


## Running Tests

    pip install -e ".[test]"
    pytest -vv tests
